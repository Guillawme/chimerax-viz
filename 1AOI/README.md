# Nucleosome acidic patch

This script generates visualizations of the nucleosome acidic patch:

1. an overview in cartoon mode, with the acidic patch residues in H2A shown as
   spheres,
2. a close up view centered on these same residues in H2A, shown as sticks this
   time, and
3. an overview in surface mode colored by electrostatic potential.
