# Nucleosome acidic patch

This script generates visualizations of the nucleosome acidic patch:

1. an overview in cartoon mode, with the acidic patch residues in H2A shown as
   spheres,
2. a close up view centered on these same residues in H2A, shown as sticks this
   time, and
3. an overview in surface mode colored by electrostatic potential.

This took about 30 seconds to run on a laptop (Intel Core i7 at 3.1 GHz, 16 GB
of RAM, Intel Iris Graphics 6100 integrated graphics card), not counting the
time it took to download the model from the PDB.
