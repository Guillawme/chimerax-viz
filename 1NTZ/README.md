# PDB entry 1NTZ

This script generates visualizations I made to help a colleague and introduce
them to ChimeraX.

This took about 15 seconds to run on a laptop (Intel Core i7 at 3.1 GHz, 16 GB
of RAM, Intel Iris Graphics 6100 integrated graphics card), not counting the
time it took to download the model from the PDB.
