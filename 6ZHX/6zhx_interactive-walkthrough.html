      <h2>Preparing the session</h2>
      <p>
        We will download PDB
        entry <a href="https://www.ebi.ac.uk/pdbe/entry/pdb/6ZHX">6ZHX</a> and
        EMDB entry
        <a href="https://www.ebi.ac.uk/emdb/entry/11220">EMD-11220</a>, which
        combined weigh a total of about 110 MB, so this will take a few seconds
        to complete, depending on your internet connection speed (next time you
        run this document it will be almost instant, because ChimeraX keeps a
        local copy of downloaded files). In addition, we will apply the same
        representations and color code as in the article figure. When you are

        At this stage, you should see the cryo-EM map at an appropriate contour
        level. Feel free to explore the map interactively before we continue. If
        you get lost, you can:
        <ul>
          <li><a class="cxcmd" href="cxcmd:view overview">reset the orientation</a>,</li>
          <li><a class="cxcmd" href="cxcmd:volume #1 level 0.0075">reset the contour level</a>,</li>
          <li>or <a class="cxcmd" href="cxcmd:view overview; volume #1 level 0.0075">reset both</a>.</li>
        </ul>
      </p>

      <h2>Looking at the cryo-EM map</h2>
      <p>
        If you are not familiar with the nucleosome, some color code will help:
        <a class="cxcmd" href="cxcmd:crossfade 30; color zone #1 near #2
        distance 12">apply color code</a>. At this stage, and assuming your went
        back to the initial orientation (or never moved away from it), you
        should see the cryo-EM map colored by chain assignment just like in
        Figure 2E of the article. The feature of this map discussed in the
        article is the presence of a peptide from
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CHD1L">ALC1</a> (pink) bound to
        the acidic patch formed by histones H2A (yellow) and H2B (red). H3 is
        shown in blue, H4 in green and the DNA in grey.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the article, we only showed one side of the nucleosome because of
        space limitations. But the nucleosome is mostly symmetric, and therefore
        has a second H2A-H2B dimer and its acidic patch on the other side. If
        you <a class="cxcmd" href="cxcmd:turn y 2 90">look at the other
        side</a>, you will see that there is an ALC1 peptide bound there as well
        (cyan). You can click on this last link as many times as you want, to
        rotate the nucleosome 180 degrees around the vertical axis.
      </p>

      <h2>Intepreting the map with an atomic model</h2>
      <p>
        Looking at the map is good, but will only take us so far. We need to
        interpret it in terms of atoms. The map looks very strong for the
        nucleosome (side chain density is clearly visible), slightly less so for
        the bound ALC1 peptide. We can first look at an atomic model with the
        histones represented as their molecular surface and the ALC1 peptide as
        spheres. <a class="cxcmd"
                    href="cxcmd:
                          crossfade 30;
                          hide #!1 models;
                          show #!2 models;
                          hide atoms;

                          show DNA cartoons;
                          show histones surfaces;
                          show ALC1 atoms;
                          color ALC1 byhetero;
                          hide H;
                          style ALC1 sphere;
                          size atomradius 1.3;
                          graphics silhouettes true">Display atomic model.</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        Let's <a class="cxcmd" href="cxcmd:view mainALC1; view name
        mainALC1view">zoom in on the peptide</a>. Let's also <a class="cxcmd"
        href="cxcmd:crossfade 60; style ALC1 stick; size stickradius 0.3">change
        its display style to sticks</a>, to better see the atoms.
      </p>
      <p>
        Feel free to rotate the view to look at it from any side. If you get
        lost, you can <a class="cxcmd" href="cxcmd:view mainALC1view">recenter
        the view on the peptide</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        We can now <a class="cxcmd" href="cxcmd: crossfade 60; color #1
        turquoise transparency 75; surface zone #1 nearatoms mainALC1 distance
        1.6; show #1">show the density map around the peptide</a> to check that
        the model is supported by the data. Again, here feel free to rotate the
        view or zoom in or out. The reset link above will bring you back to the
        view centered on the peptide, should you need it.
      </p>

        Finally, let's <a class="cxcmd"

      <h2>Comparison with the LANA peptide</h2>
      <p>
        At this point, we have interactively walked through Figures 2E and 2F of
        the article. To visit Figure 2G, we need to <a class="cxcmd"
        href="cxcmd: open 1zla">download PDB entry 1ZLA</a> which contains the
        LANA peptide bound to the acidic patch. We also need to <a class="cxcmd"
        href="cxcmd: mmaker #3/g to #2/g">align it to our nucleosome model</a>
        and <a class="cxcmd" href="cxcmd:
                                   hide histones atoms;
                                   hide DNA atoms;

                                   color H2B red;

        Almost there! We can finally also <a class="cxcmd"
