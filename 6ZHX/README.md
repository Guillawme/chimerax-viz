# Nucleosome in complex with the regulatory linker segment of ALC1

This visualization was made for the following article (but ended up not being
attached to the final published version):

Not counting the time it took to download the map and model, rendering this
movie took about 20 minutes on a laptop (Intel Core i7 at 3.1 GHz, 16 GB of RAM,
Intel Iris Graphics 6100 integrated graphics card) and about 10 minutes on a
workstation (Intel Core at i7-6900K 3.2 GHz, 128 GB of RAM, nVidia GeForce GTX
1070 Ti graphics card).

The two scripts are almost identical: `6zhx-three-parts.cxc` generates separate
movies for the three parts of the whole animation, while `6zhx-full-movie.cxc`
generates a single movie with fading transitions between the three parts.

I posted the full movie [here](https://twitter.com/Guillawme/status/1379802108321538049).
