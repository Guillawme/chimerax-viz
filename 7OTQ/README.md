# ALC1 bound to a PARylated nucleosome

## Figure panels

These images were made for the following article (not all images were used in
the published figures):

Bacic L, Gaullier G, Sabantsev A, Lehmann LC, Brackmann K, Dimakou D, Halic M,
Hewitt G, Boulton SJ & Deindl S (2021) Structure and dynamics of the chromatin
remodeler ALC1 bound to a PARylated nucleosome. *eLife* **10**: e71420
<https://doi.org/10.7554/eLife.71420>

The scripts `7otq_figure-2.cxc` and `7otq_figure-2-supplement-2.cxc` generate
panels used in Figure 2 and Figure 2 - Supplement 2, respectively. They can be
run as is.

The script `emd-13070_snapshots.cxc` generates panels used in Figures 3 and 4.
This script cannot be run right away, as it needs all maps from
[EMD-13070](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/emdb/EMD-13070?tab=interpretation) and, as far
as I know, ChimeraX cannot download the additional maps. Before attempting to
run this script, you must run `download-EMD-13070-maps.sh` to download all map
files from the EMDB and uncompress them. **This will download about 460 MB, and
decompression will write out another ~500 MB.**

## Movies

The movies generated by `7otq_three-parts-movie.cxc` and `7otq_full-movie.cxc`
are not part of the published article, they were made for conference
presentations. They generate the same movie as three separate parts or a single
file, respectively. I posted the full movie
[here](https://twitter.com/Guillawme/status/1445098262994771970).
