# ALC1 bound to an asymmetric, site-specifically PARylated nucleosome

## Figure panels

These images were made for the following article:

Bacic L, Gaullier G, Mohapatra J, Mao G, Brackmann K, Panfilov M, Liszczak G,
Sabantsev A & Deindl S (2024) Asymmetric nucleosome PARylation at DNA breaks
mediates directional nucleosome sliding by ALC1. *Nat Commun* **15**: 1000
<https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-024-45237-8>

The figures use PDB entry [8B0A](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/pdbe/entry/pdb/8B0A) and
EMDB entry [EMD-15777](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/emdb/entry/EMD-15777).

The ChimeraX command file `8b0a-figures.cxc` cannot fetch "additional maps" from
the EMDB, so you first need to run `download-additional-map.sh` to get the
necessary map (this will download a ~67 MB file). The command file can then be
run and will generate panels used in Figure 2 and Figure 2 - Supplement 2. It
generates many other visuals which we ended up not using in the article's
figures.

## Timing

Not counting the time it took to download the maps and model, running this
script took approximatively 59 seconds on a laptop (Intel Core i7 at 3.1 GHz, 16
GB of RAM, Intel Iris Graphics 6100 integrated graphics card).
